##Reflection.
The TDD approach mainly targets algorithm and backend type code, it might not be well suited for graphically interfaces.

The TDD approach definitely made me think about end goal while I created the test cases.  It was very convenient to have the tests already made and it gives me a quick way to review my application.

I definitely liked the TDD approach and plan to include it my development workflow.
